# Food Delivery Website - Frontend

This is the frontend part of a food delivery website built using Vite and React. The focus is on user authentication (login/signup), browsing food items, adding items to the cart, and placing an order.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Login and signup functionality for users, implemented purely on the frontend without storing data persistently.
- **Menu Display**: View food items with details such as name, description, and price.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add items to their cart and select quantities.
- **Cart Functionality**: View items in the cart, update quantities, and calculate the total amount.
- **Order Page**: Finalize the order with an overview of selected items and total price.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: For fast and optimized development.
- **CSS**: For styling the components.

## User Authentication

- **Login**: Allows users to log in by providing a username and password (session is cleared on refresh).
- **Signup**: Allows new users to sign up by providing basic details like username and password.
- **No Persistent Storage**: User data is not stored in local storage or a database; all data is cleared after the page is refreshed.
